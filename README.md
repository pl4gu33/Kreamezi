Kreamezi is an innovative project that aims to revolutionize the ice cream shop experience by creating an online ordering system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The project involves developing a dynamic website for Kreamezi, enabling customers to conveniently browse and order their favorite ice cream flavors from the comfort of their homes.

The website design will be visually appealing, utilizing a combination of HTML and CSS to create an enticing and user-friendly interface.
